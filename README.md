# Orbace
Simple mobile game for Ludum Dare 42. 

Tutorial not made due to time constraints.
Main objective in the game is using 4 thrusters on ship to pick up the orb and bring it back to base.
If you crash into base without orb, game over, If you crash into other planets, game over and finally
If you get outside of the bounds for more than 5 seconds game over.
